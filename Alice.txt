Alice never could quite make out, in thinking it over afterwards, how it was that they began: all she remembers is, that they were running hand in hand, and the Queen went so fast that it was all she could do to keep up with her: and still the Queen kept crying Faster! Faster! but Alice felt she could not go faster, though she had not breath left to say so.

The most curious part of the thing was, that the trees and the other things round them never changed their places at all: however fast they went, they never seemed to pass anything. I wonder if all the things move along with us? thought poor puzzled Alice. And the Queen seemed to guess her thoughts, for she cried, Faster! Dont try to talk!

Eventually, the Queen stops running and props Alice up against a tree, telling her to rest.

Alice looked round her in great surprise. Why, I do believe weve been under this tree the whole time! Everythings just as it was!

Of course it is, said the Queen, what would you have it?

Well, in our country, said Alice, still panting a little, youd generally get to somewhere else â€” if you ran very fast for a long time, as weve been doing.

A slow sort of country! said the Queen. Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place.

If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!
